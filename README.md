# CarPricePrediction

A machine learning project focused on predicting car prices based on key features such as mileage, manufacturing year, and brand using Decision Trees. The project includes data cleaning, outlier detection, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Project Overview

This project uses a regression model (Decision Trees) to estimate car prices, employing various techniques for preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter optimization. The objective is to build an accurate price prediction model for cars that can be useful for dealerships and buyers.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Outlier Detection**: Identifying and handling outliers using IQR to ensure high-quality input data.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to improve the modelâ€™s accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model with RMSE to ensure accurate predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
